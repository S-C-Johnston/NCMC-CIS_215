Relational database
===================

Named for the relation, which houses in a data structure which in many
ways resembles a two-dimensional array. Each row or tuple is a single
entity, and each column, or attribute, represents values of defined
domains. A Person relation may have attributes such as id, name, date of
birth, etc.

 - Degree: # of attributes a relation contains
 - Cardinality: # of tuples in a relation. Also commonly used to
   describe the interactions of different relations, in the form of 1:1,
   1:m, and n:m.
