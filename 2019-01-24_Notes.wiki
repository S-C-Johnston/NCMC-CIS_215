Relational database
===================

Named for the relation, which houses in a data structure which in many
ways resembles a two-dimensional array. Each row or tuple is a single
entity, and each column, or attribute, represents values of defined
domains. A Person relation may have attributes such as id, name, date of
birth, etc.

 - Degree: # of attributes a relation contains
 - Cardinality: # of tuples in a relation. Also commonly used to
   describe the interactions of different relations, in the form of 1:1,
   1:m, and n:m.
   
See the [[glossary]]

A base table is the actual table stored in a database. A virtual table,
by contrast, is not stored in that format, but constructed from other
data and held in memory for use.

[[Primary keys]] uniquely identify tuples in a relation. A foreign key
in a tuple identifies a primary key from another tuple.

Database languages
------------------

SQL is a superset of some smaller formal languages, which mostly don't
interact and are fairly self-contained. The subset languages include:

 - Data Definition Language (DDL): A set of commands that create items
   requiring strict definition in a database. These include tables,
   views, indices, and the schema.

 - Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands which enable the
   retrieval, insertion, modification and deletion of data.

 - Data Control Language (DCL): A formal language for defining access
   rights for users and logins on a database.
