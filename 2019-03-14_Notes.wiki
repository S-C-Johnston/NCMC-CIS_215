Physical Design
---------------

Physical Database Design is performed after the conceptual design has
been completed, and requirements for data is understood.

Physical Design considerations for choosing and designing for any
particular RDBMS inlude:
- How base relations are created in the DBMS
- Support for primary and foreign keys
- Support for definition of requisitie data. Does it support NOT NULL?
- Support for predefined domains
- Support for enterprise constraints

The dialect of SQL and its DDL component may vary based on the RDBMS,
but ANSI or ISO SQL standards are likely to be well supported. If the
RDBMS supports a standard, there will be nothing lost by using it, but
some platform specific features may not be used.
