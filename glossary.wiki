Relation: Formal language for a table in two dimensions, which has
tuples (rows) and attributes (columns).

Tuple: Formal language for a row. Taken from mathematics language,
meaning a finite and ordered list of elements. Likewise, tuples have a
finite number of attributes in a specific order.

Attribute: Formal language for column. Contains a value in a defined
domain, with the constraint that an attribute can't be out of domain.

Domain: "A set of permissible values". Formal language for describing a
data type, which often goes into detail to both the broad kind and its
specifics, For example, a person's name is not just a string, but a
string containing only alphabetical characters and likely smaller than
25 characters.

Degree: The number of attributes in a given relation.

Cardinality: Multiple uses. The first of which I became aware is the
interaction between relations, such that a tuple is said to be related
to another in cardinality of 1:1, 1:many, or n:m. The use described in
lesson 2 is of the number of entities in a table.

Entity: The "real" element about which data needs to be stored.
