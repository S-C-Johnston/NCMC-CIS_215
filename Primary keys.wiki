A primary key is important for unambiguously selecting a given tuple.
Of the most convenient and common means of selecting a primary key, an
arbitrary number is chief among them; this can be done by randomly
generating ids not having been used ever before, or by auto-incrementing
over time. Auto-incrementing values are typically faster and easier to
implement.

A primary key can be composed of multiple columns. This is a composite
key.

Best practices
--------------

 - Should have a value that is extremely unlikely to be null
 - Should be a value that will never change
 - Should not, despite the temptation, be made of meaningful data, if
   possible.
 - Should be made of the least number of columns necessary to ensure
   uniqueness
